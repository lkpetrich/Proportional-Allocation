# Allocates seats for the European Parliament using different algorithms
# in an attempt to reverse-engineer the algorithm
#
# Returns:
# header line
# list of (name, votes, allocation in each of the algorithms)
#
# D'Hondt 0 -- seat bonus independent of the allocation
# D'Hondt 1 -- seat bonus included as initial counts in the allocation
#
# It has some additional tests for testing the minimum-seats and maximum-seats
# parts of the algorithms: the same sort of pairs for:
# Sainte-LaguÃ«, largest-remainders Hare, and adjusted-divisor Webster
