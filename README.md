# Proportional-Allocation
For doing proportional allocation and representation.

Implements:
- Highest averages (D'Hondt, Sainte-LaguÃ«, Huntington-Hill, etc.)
- Largest remainders (Hare, Droop, Imperiali)
- Adjusted divisor (Jefferson, Webster, Adams)
Has the options of minimum and maximum numbers of seats.
Also includes initial numbers of seats for highest-averages, both constant and a rounded-down approximation.
